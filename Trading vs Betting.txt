Unique thing about smart contract on future events:
- Time limit
- Market-determined odds

Trading vs Betting

For betting, if you stake $50, you're prepared to lose everything or win more. Losers pay winners, the third-party is willing to accept some loss if its odds fail.
For trading, you can buy/sell before the deadline.

For buying smart contracts, you may not earn enough to justify the initial investment. 

We can take the in-between with hedging.

So if you're afraid of losing everything, some third-person offers to step in as an insurer similar to Singapore pools or some bank.
